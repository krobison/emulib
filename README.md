##EmuLib

todo:

remove weird side menu, i dont like it anymore
maybe change up the navbar too

make the lib page auto-overflow-y but look similar to how it does now, maybe even hide cursor? just so that you can always see the breadcrumbs and the navbar and no stupid affixing hell.

make searching work :P
