##EmuLib

###todo:
* remove weird side menu, i dont like it anymore
* maybe change up the navbar too
* make the lib page auto-overflow-y but look similar to how it does now, maybe even hide scroll? just so that you can always see the breadcrumbs and the navbar and no stupid affixing hell.
* make searching work :P
* make it so selecting the boxart button will expand other buttons like, "full, front, side, back"
* make it so selecting the cart button will expand buttons, "front, top" (MAYBE, depends on the avalaibility of top pics)
* we need some facebook shares up in this bitch
* launching of course
* native rating system / review system
* pretty landing page
* users
