##EmuLib

###todo:
* ~~remove weird side menu, i dont like it anymore~~
* maybe change up the navbar too
* make the lib page auto-overflow-y but look similar to how it does now, maybe even hide scroll? just so that you can always see the breadcrumbs and the navbar and no stupid affixing hell.
* make searching work :P
* ~~make it so selecting the boxart button will expand other buttons like, "full, front, side, back"~~
* ~~instead make it so that it goes to full automatically (or front?) and if boxart is selected, it will display the other view options. less jquery, less prone to error, less weirdness expecting to see a view but instead getting more buttons~~
* make it so selecting the cart button will expand buttons, "front, top" (MAYBE, depends on the avalaibility of top pics)
* we need some facebook shares up in this bitch
* launching of course
* native rating system / review system
* pretty landing page
* users
* make the sprites on the list page just cideo game sprites or blank/some DIFFERENT generic sprite. Use the NES controller for the individual view still, and use game controllers in the list of ALL games to differentiate between consols
